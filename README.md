# WhiteNoise-For-Sol
The implementation of privacy p2p network protocol for Solana ecosystem in Rust.

WhiteNoise-For-Sol constructs a p2p privacy network library, it makes Solana more convenient to connect to the Evanesco Layer0 Network for data transmission. 
The Evanesco Layer0 Network uses the WhiteNoise network protocol, through multi-hop links, traffic obfuscation and advanced cryptography technology, to ensure the privacy of upper-layer applications in all aspects.
After Solana accesses the Evanesco network through this library, it will obtain smooth data transmission capabilities and superior network privacy. 
Users and DApps are also able to participate in Solana ecosystem with better secure and privacy protection.
